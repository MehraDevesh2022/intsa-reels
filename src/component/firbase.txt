 {/* this is how to we use Route passing the path and component inside of it */}
        {/* this is one of the way to right route component where path is props and login is component */}
        {/* but there is another version also to right route when we need to add some logic with route */}
        {/* <Route path='/feed' render={(props) =>{
          return <Feed></Feed>
         }}></Route> */}
        {/* this is how to another way we have option to right Route where we have render method and render take props as a parameter and we have option to write logic inside return */}


        // get and set data =>
          data stores as collection (eg : user) in db and each collection has document 
          document : key and value pair are document in every collection eg > name : "Rahul" 

        fire base has to way to set data =>
          add => using add we dont have option to set our id for every document . it is automatically provided by firebase . so later its hard to get user data from Databse
          set => on the otherhand we have set and set method provide option to set id for every user . using that id we have option to get user data easyly
